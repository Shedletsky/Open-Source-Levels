This project is a collection of games that have been uncopylocked. The repository associated with this project is used to preserve games that are considered at risk to become unavailable in the future or that are already unavailable. These games include games that have previously been uncopylocked but are not anymore, ROBLOX games (because they are notorious for having been disabled, copylocked again or removed in the past) and games that are reasonably likely to become unavailable at some point.

Anyone may suggest the addition of a game to this collection. This can be done on GitHub, by sending a pull request or filing an issue on the repository associated with this collection. This repository is owned by the RobloxLabs organization.

This collection does not include games that have been stolen or are of a low quality or have almost no content. Such games should not be submitted. One may legitimately use material from any of these games in any project.

A catalog of the games is available in the file named catalog.md.
